It's Hot. The AC doesen't work in this neighborhood.
$51 Trillion for the Musk families new B.T.R (Biome Temperature Regulation).
Still not enough to cover the entire city.
The hotter it gets the more heat the virals bring.

Could try the AR (Augmented Reality) cammo, or use the Edu-link. It gives you a headache everytime.

What should I do?
1. Hope the AR Cammo works.
2. Link up.
